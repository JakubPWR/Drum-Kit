###JS Drum Kit
Overview
The JS Drum Kit is a web-based application that allows users to play drum sounds by pressing keyboard keys. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing interactive sound functionality and basic web design.

###Features
Play drum sounds by pressing specific keys on the keyboard.
Visual feedback through animation when a key is pressed.
Simple and clean user interface.
###Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the webpage.
CSS: Styling and layout, including responsive design.
JavaScript: Functionality for playing sounds and handling user interactions.
###How It Works
The drum kit consists of two drum pads (A for clap and S for hi-hat). Each pad is linked to an audio file that plays when the corresponding key is pressed.
The JavaScript code listens for keyboard events and plays the appropriate sound. It also adds a visual effect to the keys when pressed.
The current implementation features only two drum pads, but you can easily expand it by copying the existing HTML and JavaScript code and modifying the sound files as needed.
###Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open index.html in your web browser.
Press the keys 'A' and 'S' to play the sounds.
###Future Enhancements
Add more drum pads by replicating the existing structure and linking new sound files.
Improve the UI design for a better user experience.
Implement mobile support for touch devices.
###License
This project is open-source and available for anyone to use and modify.
